# Premier League Last Man Standing

This project aims to create a model that will compete in a Premier League Last Man Standing competition.

Last Man Standing is a game where, for a given span of time, competitors pick a football team each week. They cannot pick the same
team twice. If their team does not win that week, they are out of the competition. The last competitor standing wins.

Therefore, there are a few factors to take into account when picking the optimal set of teams. The likelihood of a team winning is the primary
metric to consider. However, the strength of the team should also be considered - if two teams have equal chances of winning their fixture, the
"weaker" team should be preferred as the stronger team could be used on a different week. Earlier weeks should also be favoured - there is no point
saving top teams for the later weeks as there is less chance of reaching this stage.
